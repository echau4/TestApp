# Thesis project

## Goals

- Understand the risks of transmitting and storing sensitive patient data
- Study different access control strategies to mitigate the unauthorized access of this data ðŸ‘†
- Figure out the pros and cons of current industry best practices

## Solution

- Create a simple web application
- Use best-practices to store and retrieve data from a remote data source
- Only authorized individuals should be able to access this data

## Outstanding questions

1.  Who has the ability to modify data?
2.  Why can't we rely on the built-in security model of the database?
3.  Why isn't HTTPS sufficient?
4.  What is the citation format required? 

## Possible database options

- Index DB
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- mySQL
- Knex.js
- MariaDB

## To-Do Tasks

- set up HTTPS to transmit data to server 
- Figure out database to use
- Make save and get function to save and get data from data storage place
- Rough draft of prospectus
- Set up a time to meet with thesis advisors to review draft and progress 
- Regular update to annotated bibliography  

## Prospectus [In Progress]

Data privacy and protection has always been a concern, especially when it concerns patient data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act are good examples of this. With the IT enhancements in healthcare, collecting and analyzing data from patients to help care providers to improve the care quality is easier and more in demand than ever. With the practice of using Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect real-time data and monitor a patient's well-being, the need to enforce secure protocols and procedures is essential. In the realms of healthcare, the data stored and collected are sensitive and confidential. This thesis will go over and explain the security vulnerabilities throughout the process of data entry, storage, and retrieval. To do so, a simplistic prototype of a patient entry form and database will be created. The form will take in names of patients, sends the names to a database, and allows only authorized personnel to access the data. Research will go into how to build this form and then we will proceed to the building of the prototype. After creation, more research will go into the known security vulnerabilities and the prototype will be used to test these findings. The form will then be modified to prevent it from the same exploitation again. Eventually, the goal is to have a secure form that can be used for testing and identifying new exploits. This project aims to help others understand the basics of the security best practices and known common vulnerabilities. It will also present some new concerns and present ideas of how to solve them.

Healthcare cost takes up 17.6% of GDP in 2014, but with the rise of big data in healthcare, $100 billion of profits could be made if used at the fullest potential. Healthcare is moving to be digitalized contributing to the rise of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for accurate and shareable data. Gartner estimates 26 billion IoT devices will be functional by 2020 and the amount of traffic generated, it can be categorized as big data. 

Body Sensor Networks (BSN) gives care providers the ability to monitor vital parameters, medication effectiveness, and predict an epidemic. With this, there needs to be common data representation that encompasses industry standards and local and regional standards because BSN data collection is diverse in source and often needs to be normalized, standardized, and goveranced before analysis. HIPPA certified healthcare data centers doesnâ€™t mean the procedures/policies will be implemented. 

The sheer amount of IoT devices makes the common symmetric/asymmetric key distribution not possible and there needs to be a new scalable key management solution in order for the devices to integrate with cloud. The attacks most frequent to the healthcare industry are DDoS, social engineering, and cognitive bias. Big incidents that was reported are Kaiser Permanente (lost of an unencrypted USB containing 49,000 patient records in 2013), Verizon (internal forensic division investigation report found out of 47,000 security incidents, 621 confirmed data breaches in 2012), a study on patient and data privacy (94% of hospitals had at least 1 breach in past 2 years), and Target Corporation (sent baby coupons to teen unknown to parents). Take away: practice data anonymization prior to analytics and preserve encryption when running prediction algorithms.
